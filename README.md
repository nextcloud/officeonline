# Office Online integration

![](./screenshot.png)

## Branches

We currently maintain two branches for compatibility with Nextcloud versions:

- main (Nextcloud 24 upwards)
- stable1 (Nextcloud 22-23)

## Development setup

Just clone this repo into your apps directory ([Nextcloud server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server#running-master-checkouts) installation needed). Additionally, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) are needed for installing JavaScript dependencies and building the frontend code.

Once npm and Node.js are installed, this can be done by running:
```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Installation

### Server

You will need an working on-premise Office Online server which has added the Nextcloud server as a trusted host for WOPI. The cloud-based Office 365 is not supported.

## Known problems

- Users are not removed or document is not unlocked with Chrome (or chromium-based browsers)
  - This is a known problem according to different sources for the Office Online Server and is out of scope of the Nextcloud intergration. You can work around this by configuring a lock timeout for the files_lock app or manually unlocking file file
